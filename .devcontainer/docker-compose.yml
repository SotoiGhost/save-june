    # Uncomment the next line to use a non-root user for all processes. You can also
    # simply use the "remoteUser" property in devcontainer.json if you just want VS Code
    # and its sub-processes (terminals, tasks, debugging) to execute as the user. On Linux,
    # you may need to update USER_UID and USER_GID in .devcontainer/Dockerfile to match your
    # user if not 1000. See https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/non-root for details.
